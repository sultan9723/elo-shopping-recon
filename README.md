# 🛡️ ELO Shopping Recon Tool

**ELO Shopping Recon** is an automated cybersecurity reconnaissance tool that scans websites to find security weaknesses. It performs the following tasks:

- 🔍 Identifies open ports and running services using **Nmap**
- 🧠 Detects technologies used by the website via **WhatWeb**
- 🔓 Brute-forces hidden directories using **Gobuster**
- 🚨 Checks for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) related to discovered services
- 🗂️ Automatically saves raw scan results and generates a final human-readable report

This tool is built for penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, or cybersecurity students who want to speed up initial recon.

> ✅ All scans are saved with timestamps and organized neatly into folders.
